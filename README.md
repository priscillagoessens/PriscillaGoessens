## Running locally
- Requirements: Node, NPM and Yarn (LTS)*
- Navigate to your cloned project, and run `yarn` on a terminal
- Create a file named `.env.local` and add the PAT environment variable here (`PAT=<40-character-pat>`)
- Run `yarn dev` to test the Next.js app on `localhost:3000`
- Production builds can also be tested using `yarn build` and `yarn start`

*`npm` commands also work
